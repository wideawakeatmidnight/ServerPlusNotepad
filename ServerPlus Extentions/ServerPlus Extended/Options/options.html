      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>ServerPlus Notepad was developed for experienced ServerPlus Technicians. It is meant to solve the common problems and ineffiecines that are associated with taking notes and interacting with Tracker during a call.</p>
      <h2>Efficient and Accurate Notetaking</h2>
      <p>Taking good notes is critical to our occupation.  Our notes are our primary expression to ServerPlus clients that we are effectively performing our job. This is why escalated tickets are evaluated so scrupulously; these tickets are guaranteed to be viewed by the company. Their Tier 2 department is reliant on the information that we provide to adequately perform their function.  And we can all appreciate when we open up a subscriber's profile and discover detailed notes that assist us in determining the most effect approach to helping them on them resolve their issues.</p>
      <p>The problem lies in the fact that taking detailed notes can be very time consuming.  The necessary information that we are required to consolidate and present is diverse and scattered.  Collecting it requires patience, time and persistence.  However, the abundance of time is something that we don’t always have at our disposal.  The customer and our employer wants the issue resolved as quickly as possible. Other customers are waiting for our assistance. Completing the necessary tasks involved in extensive note taking while while entertaining a consumer and with a clock dictating that you should have resolved their issue earlier can be irritating and stressful. Our desire to complete an issue as quickly as possible can result in poor note taking.</p>
      <p>ServerPlus Notepad purpose is to assist with balancing these two occasionally conflicting requirements.  The goal is to increase note taking accuracy while simultaneously reducing the amount of time it takes to compose these notes.

In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.</p>
